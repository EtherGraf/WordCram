WordCram lets you generate [word
clouds](http://images.google.com/images?q=word+cloud) in Processing.
It does the heavy lifting -- text analysis, collision detection -- for
you, so you can focus on making your word clouds as beautiful, as
revealing, or as silly as you like.

## Make a Word Cloud

```java
import wordcram.*;

// Set up the Processing sketch
size(1000, 600);
colorMode(HSB);
background(230);

// Make a wordcram from a random wikipedia page.
new WordCram(this)
  .fromWebPage("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random")
  .withColors(color(30), color(110),
              color(random(255), 240, 200))
  .sizedByWeight(5, 120)
  .withFont("Copse")
  .drawAll();
```

You can control where words appear, what angle they're at, their font,
their color, and how they're sized.
