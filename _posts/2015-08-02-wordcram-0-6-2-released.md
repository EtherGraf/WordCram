I just released [WordCram 0.6.2](//wordcram.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/wordcram.0.6.2.zip)!

Thanks to [Alan Orth](https://github.com/alanorth) for letting me know that Wikipedia now forces HTTPS, and Processing can't handle the 302s. I updated the examples sketches, too.

This release also contains a tiny performance improvement that should speed things up.

Happy word cramming!
